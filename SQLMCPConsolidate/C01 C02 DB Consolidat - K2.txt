Hi Team,
 
As you know IT is in the process to migrate on-premises server to MCP environment, K2 Dbs and components are in the scope of the server migration, can you please assist with the tasks as following?
1. Review and confirm if K2 uses the database, SQL Services can migrate these databases to MCP environment if required;  
3. Reconfigure K2 and components to connect to new MCP SQL environment; 
 
In the project scope: Shared SQL instance AUNDDPDSQC01, AUNDDPDSQC02 in Production environment.
