DB migration to MCP - SQL cluster instance AUNDDPDSQC01 in production - Lync databases and SQL components

Hi Team,
 
As you know IT is in the process to migrate on-premises server to MCP environment, Lync are in the scope of the server migration, can you please assist with the tasks as following?
1. Review and confirm if Lync still uses these databases;
2. SQL Services can migrate these databases to MCP environment if required;  
2. Reconfigure Lync and components to connect to new MCP SQL environment;

Hi David, 

It appeared the Lync databases were created around 2013, no active connection to it at the time checking from SQL sessions today, possible Lync has been reconfigured to use other server(s), over to you to look into it and confirm assuming you look after AD? 

Give me a yell if anything does not make sense.
